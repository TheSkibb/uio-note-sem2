# Concepts
*core concepts in cyber security*

## Cybersecurity

> Protecting information by preventing, detecting and responding to attacks

## Information security

> Protecting information from unauthorized access and modification.

## Cyber Physical System - CPS

> Smart systems that include engineered interacting networks of physical and computation components

> Integrate computation, communication, **sensing** and **actuating** with physical systems

> CPSs are systems which have a purpose to **interact** with the physical world.

## Cyber Physical System Security

> Ensure CPS capabilities are not compromized and info is "safe"

## CIA triad

> the goal of cybersecurity is to ensure the CIA triad
> **C**onfidentiality - information should not be accessible to unauthorized actors
> **I**ntegrity - unauthorized actors should not be able to modify information
> **A**vailability - authorized actors should always be able to access their information and services

## Parkerian Hexad

> Adds extra properties to the [[#CIA triad]]

> Possession or control

## Levels of security breach impact

> Typically divided into three levels of impact:
> **Low**: loss has limited impact
> **Moderate**: loss has a serious effect
> **High**: loss has a severe effect

## Attack surface

> Attack surface refers to the reachable and exploitable vulnerabiilities in a system.
> *Where in a system is an attack possible*

## Attack tree

> A branching hierarchical structure created to map out threats
